  <p>When I was first working on BrowserHistory1, it all went quite smoothly, as I finished around 18/19 minutes, almost past the standard time and went into “did not finish” territory. It actually took me a very long time trying to set up and get used to the WOD activity format. I spent about 3+ minutes just trying to save the images onto my desktop as well as a long time trying to decide and find the links to use for the external links for each section. Speaking of external links, I forgot how to add external links in HTML so I had to look it up on google and used W3School’s website to further familair myself and then I continued with my WOD after reviewing it and also taking a break. 
BrowserHistory2 was KILLING me in the beginning. I fully understood what I needed to do and jumped right in, however adding the Oswald google font was NOT going my way. THEN, after pausing for a bit and having a mini crisis, I realized that the font was not updating because I was just not saving my code therefore the server’s code was not updating even after I refreshed. I kept thinking that I was doing something wrong and going in cirlces for a bit. However, after that bump I would say that everything went smoothly by my standards.
I struggled a lot with BrowserHistory3, going past the standard time and finished around the 21+ minute mark. My recording software for some reason, gave up after a the first recording. I was pretty much doing most things very wrong, and after struggling for the majority of the time, I decided to watch the screencast video and realized my mistake of using # instead of . in CSS when tryig to define the properties of the different sections. Then I realized that my CSS had a syntax error and was just missing semi-colons and aftr I added that, the code finally started to work.</p>

<p>One advice I would give is to definitely struggle. I think that is the best way to learn and absorb the material you are working on and also having it being more deeply rooted in your brain to then recall faster and use. Additionally, I also would recommend to being more careful when working on your code, making sure to not make stupid small mistakes like me and being more careful with your syntax because you can go in circles with your code and not realize what mistake(s) you made.</p>
