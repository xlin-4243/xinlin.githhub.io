I decided to take ITM 352 due to my interest in the MIS major. The reason why I am interested in the MIS major is because I was previously interested in computer science, but after struggling in the large lecture format of the class I was heavily discouraged. However, I was still interested in the topics regarding softwares and coding and after talking to a couple of friends of mines that major in MIS as well as a couple of professors, they recommended MIS as it relates to business which is more related to my major at the moment; Finance.
